abstract = {While conventional interior models for Jupiter and Saturn are based on the simplistic assumption of a solid core surrounded by a homogeneous gaseous envelope, we derive new models with an inhomogeneous distribution of heavy elements, i.e. a gradient of composition, within these planets. Such a compositional stratification hampers large scale convection which turns into double-diffusive convection, yielding an inner thermal profile which departs from the traditionally assumed adiabatic interior, affecting these planet heat content and cooling history. To address this problem, we develop an analytical approach of layered double-diffusive convection and apply this formalism to Solar System gaseous giant planet interiors. These models satisfy all observational constraints and yield a metal enrichment for our gaseous giants up to 30 to 60{\%} larger than previously thought. The models also constrain the size of the convective layers within the planets. As the heavy elements tend to be redistributed within the gaseous envelope, the models predict smaller than usual central cores inside Saturn and Jupiter, with possibly no core for this latter. These models open a new window and raise new challenges on our understanding of the internal structure of giant (solar and extrasolar) planets, in particular on the determination of their heavy material content, a key diagnostic for planet formation theories.},

abstract = {The final stage of planet formation is dominated by collisions between planetary embryos. The dynamics of this stage determine the orbital configuration and the mass and composition of planets in the system. In the solar system, late giant impacts have been proposed for Mercury, Earth, Mars, and Pluto. In the case of Mercury, this giant impact may have significantly altered the bulk composition of the planet. Here we present the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of high-velocity (up to {\~{}}5 v{\_}esc) collisions between 1 and 10 M{\_}Earth planets of initially terrestrial composition to investigate the end stages of formation of extrasolar super-Earths. As found in previous simulations of collisions between smaller bodies, when collision energies exceed simple merging, giant impacts are divided into two regimes: (1) disruption and (2) hit-and-run (a grazing inelastic collision and projectile escape). Disruption occurs when the impact parameter is near zero, when the projectile mass is small compared to the target, or at extremely high velocities. In the disruption regime, we derive the criteria for catastrophic disruption (when half the total colliding mass is lost), the transition energy between accretion and erosion, and a scaling law for the change in bulk composition (iron-to-silicate ratio) resulting from collisional stripping of a mantle.},

abstract = {The Juno spacecraft has measured Jupiter's low-order, even gravitational moments, {\$}J{\_}2{\$}--{\$}J{\_}8{\$}, to an unprecedented precision, providing important constraints on the density profile and core mass of the planet. Here we report on a selection of interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of hydrogen-helium mixtures. We demonstrate that a dilute core, expanded to a significant fraction of the planet's radius, is helpful in reconciling the calculated {\$}J{\_}n{\$} with Juno's observations. Although model predictions are strongly affected by the chosen equation of state, the prediction of an enrichment of {\$}Z{\$} in the deep, metallic envelope over that in the shallow, molecular envelope holds. We estimate Jupiter's core to contain an 7--25 Earth mass of heavy elements. We discuss the current difficulties in reconciling measured {\$}J{\_}n{\$} with the equations of state, and with theory for formation and evolution of the planet.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by the International Astronautical Federation. All rights reserved. The study of particles in close to zero gravity is vital to the study of asteroids and the science of planet formation. Laboratory studies of dust coagulation in microgravity are limited to less than ten seconds on drop tower experiments, and tens of seconds on parabolic flights, much shorter than the onset of gravitational effects. Longer duration experiments have been conducted on the International Space Station; however, the experimental methodology is restrictive due to astronaut safety concerns. We are developing a low cost CubeSat laboratory that we call the Asteroid Origins Satellite (AOSAT), which will help us to study how asteroids formed and to obtain a greater understanding of their surface properties. The central chamber of AOSAT will house the spacecraft electronics (computer system, attitude control system, communications system, etc.). The outer experimental chambers will be equipped using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to measure fundamental regolith and coagulation properties, including stereo cameras, accelerometers, and gyros. In order to make the experimental environment as representative of the early solar system as possible, AOSAT will carry fine fragments of native asteroid material (i.e. pulverized meteorite regolith) into orbit. In the zero-spin state the particles will act similar to the particles in the early solar system allowing us to study the accretion process over months in orbit. In the spun-up state, the CubeSat will serve as a centrifuge and will create two 'patches' with similar microgravity as the surface of asteroids. By mimicking the native asteroid environments in sufficient detail, AOSAT will be a laboratory for direct research into primary accretion and asteroid surface properties. The microgravity environment inside the CubeSat (0 to 10 {\textless} sup {\textgreater} -4 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater}  g) will enable scaled down versions of future experiments that will help validate engineering approaches for next-generation asteroid landers and robotic systems. We will compare in-orbit particle behavior to numerical granular media simulations, using our Astrophysical Rubble-piles Simulation Software (ARSS) in order to better understand the physics involved.},

@article{Nettelmann2015,
abstract = {Jupiter's atmosphere has been observed to be depleted in helium (Yatm{\~{}}0.24), suggesting active helium sedimentation in the interior. This is accounted for in standard Jupiter structure and evolution models through the assumption of an outer, He-depleted envelope that is separated from the He-enriched deep interior by a sharp boundary. Here we aim to develop a model for Jupiter's inhomogeneous thermal evolution that relies on a more self-consistent description of the internal profiles of He abundance, temperature, and heat flux. We make use of recent numerical simulations on H/He demixing, and on layered (LDD) and oscillatory (ODD) double diffusive convection, and assume an idealized planet model composed of a H/He envelope and a massive core. A general framework for the construction of interior models with He rain is described. Despite, or perhaps because of, our simplifications made we find that self-consistent models are rare. For instance, no model for ODD convection is found. We modify the H/He phase diagram of Lorenzen et al. to reproduce Jupiter's atmospheric helium abundance and examine evolution models as a function of the LDD layer height, from those that prolong Jupiter's cooling time to those that actually shorten it. Resulting models that meet the luminosity constraint have layer heights of about 0.1-1 km, corresponding to {\~{}}10,-20,000 layers in the rain zone between {\~{}}1 and 3-4.5 Mbars. Present limitations and directions for future work are discussed, such as the formation and sinking of He droplets.},

abstract = {The core mass of Saturn is commonly assumed to be 10-25M⊕as predicted by interior models with various equations of state (EOSs) and the Voyager gravity data, and hence larger than that of Jupiter (0-10M⊕). We here re-analyze Saturn's internal structure and evolution by using more recent gravity data from the Cassini mission and different physical equations of state: the ab initio LM-REOS which is rather soft in Saturn's outer regions but stiff at high pressures, the standard Sesame-EOS which shows the opposite behavior, and the commonly used SCvH-i EOS. For all three EOS we find similar core mass ranges, i.e. of 0-20M⊕for SCvH-i and Sesame EOS and of 0-17M⊕for LM-REOS. Assuming an atmospheric helium mass abundance of 18{\%}, we find maximum atmospheric metallicities, Zatmof 7× solar for SCvH-i and Sesame-based models and a total mass of heavy elements, MZof 25-30M⊕. Some models are Jupiter-like. With LM-REOS, we find MZ=16-20M⊕, less than for Jupiter, and Zatm≲3× solar. For Saturn, we compute moment of inertia values $\lambda$=0.2355(5). Furthermore, we confirm that homogeneous evolution leads to cooling times of only {\~{}}2.5Gyr, independent on the applied EOS. Our results demonstrate the need for accurately measured atmospheric helium and oxygen abundances, and of the moment of inertia for a better understanding of Saturn's structure and evolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Saturn's C ring contains multiple spiral patterns that appear to be density waves driven by periodic gravitational perturbations. In other parts of Saturn's rings, such waves are generated by Lindblad resonances with Saturn's various moons, but most of the wave-like C-ring features are not situated near any strong resonance with any known moon. Using stellar occultation data obtained by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on board the Cassini spacecraft, we investigate the origin of six unidentified C-ring waves located between 80,900 and 87,200 km from Saturn's center. By measuring differences in the waves' phases among the different occultations, we are able to determine both the number of arms in each spiral pattern and the speeds at which these patterns rotate around the planet. We find that all six of these waves have between two and four arms and pattern speeds between 1660° day –1 and 1861° day –1 . These speeds are too large to be attributed to any satellite resonance. Instead, they are comparable to the predicted pattern speeds of waves generated by low-order normal-mode oscillations within the planet. The precise pattern speeds associated with these waves should therefore provide strong constraints on Saturn's internal structure. Furthermore, we identify multiple waves with the same number of arms and very similar pattern speeds, indicating that multiple m = 3 and m = 2 sectoral ( l = m ) modes may exist within the planet.},

abstract = {The Coriolis force, named after French mathematician Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis (1792–1843), has traditionally been derived as a matter of coordinate transformation by an essentially kinematic technique. This has had the consequence that its physical significance for processes in the atmosphere, as well for simple mechanical systems, has not been fully comprehended. A study of Coriolis's own scientific career and achievements shows how the discovery of the Coriolis force was linked, not to any earth sciences, but to early nineteenth century mechanics and industrial developments. His own approach, which followed from a general discussion of the energetics of a rotating mechanical system, provides an alternative and more physical way to look at and understand, for example, its property as a complementary centrifugal force. It also helps to clarify the relation between angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy and how an inertial force can have a significant affect on the movement of a body and still without doing any work. Applying Coriolis's principles elucidates cause and effect aspects of the dynamics and energetics of the atmosphere, the geostrophic adjustment process, the circulation around jet streams, the meridional extent of the Hadley cell, the strength and location of the subtropical jet stream, and the phenomenon of “downstream development” in the zonal westerlies.},

But Jupiter's zonal wind is not north/south symmetric so at most some average of the north/south zonal winds could be an expression of cylinders. Here we explore the signature in the gravitational moments of such a smooth differential rotation. We carry out this investigation with two general methods for solving for the interior structure of a differentially rotating planet: the CMS method of Hubbard (Hubbard, W.B. [2013]. Astrophys. J. 768, 1-8) and the CLC method of Wisdom (Wisdom, J. [1996]. Non-Perturbative Hydrostatic Equilibrium. http://web.mit.edu/wisdom/www/interior.pdf). The two methods are in remarkable agreement. We find that for smooth differential rotation the moments do not level off as they do for strong differential rotation.},

abstract = {The present OSS (Outer Solar System) mission continues a long and bright tradition by associating the communities of fundamental physics and planetary sciences in a single mission with ambitious goals in both domains. OSS is an M-class mission to explore the Neptune system almost half a century after the flyby of the Voyager 2 spacecraft. Several discoveries were made by Voyager 2, including the Great Dark Spot (which has now disappeared) and Triton's geysers. Voyager 2 revealed the dynamics of Neptune's atmosphere and found four rings and evidence of ring arcs above Neptune. Benefiting from a greatly improved instrumentation, a mission as OSS would result in a striking advance in the study of the farthest planet of the solar system. Furthermore, OSS would provide a unique opportunity to visit a selected Kuiper Belt object subsequent to the passage of the Neptunian system. OSS would help consolidate the hypothesis of the origin of Triton as a Kuiper Belt object captured by Neptune, and to improve our knowledge on the formation of the solar system. The OSS probe would carry instruments allowing precise tracking of the spacecraft during the cruise. It would facilitate the best possible tests of the laws of gravity in deep space. These objectives are important for fundamental physics, as they test General Relativity, our current theoretical description of gravitation, but also for cosmology, astrophysics and planetary science, as General Relativity is used as a tool in all these domains. In particular, the models of solar system formation uses General Relativity to describe the crucial role of gravity. OSS is proposed as an international cooperation between ESA and NASA, giving the capability for ESA to launch an M-class mission towards the farthest planet of the solar system, and to a Kuiper Belt object. The proposed mission profile would allow to deliver a 500 kg class spacecraft. The design of the probe is mainly constrained by the deep space gravity test in order to minimize the perturbation of the accelerometer measurement.},

abstract = {'Empirical' models (pressure vs. density) of Uranus and Neptune interiors constrained by the gravitational coefficients J{\_}2, J{\_}4, the planetary radii and masses, and Voyager solid-body rotation periods are presented. The empirical pressure-density profiles are then interpreted in terms of physical equations of state of hydrogen, helium, ice (H{\_}2O), and rock (SiO{\_}2) to test the physical plausibility of the models. The compositions of Uranus and Neptune are found to be similar with somewhat different distributions of the high-Z material. The big difference between the two planets is that Neptune requires a non-solar envelope while Uranus is best matched with a solar composition envelope. Our analysis suggests that the heavier elements in both Uranus' and Neptune's interior might increase gradually towards the planetary centers. Indeed it is possible to fit the gravitational moments without sharp compositional transitions.},

@article{Greenstreet2015,
abstract = {The New Horizons spacecraft fly-through of the Pluto system in July 2015 will provide humanity's first data for the crater populations on Pluto and its binary companion, Charon. In principle, these surfaces could be dated in an absolute sense, using the observed surface crater density ({\#} craters/km2 larger than some threshold crater diameter D). Success, however, requires an understanding of both the cratering physics and absolute impactor flux. The Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS) L7 synthetic model of classical and resonant Kuiper belt populations (Petit, J.M. et al. [2011]. Astron. J. 142, 131–155; Gladman, B. et al. [2012]. Astron. J. 144, 23–47) and the scattering object model of Kaib et al. (Kaib, N., Ro{\v{s}}kar, R., Quinn, T. [2011]. Icarus 215, 491–507) calibrated by Shankman et al. (Shankman, C. et al. [2013]. Astrophys. J. 764, L2–L5) provide such impact fluxes and thus current primary cratering rates for each dynamical sub-population. We find that four sub-populations (the q{\textless}42AU hot and stirred main classicals, the classical outers, and the plutinos) dominate Pluto's impact flux, each providing ≈15–25{\%} of the total rate. Due to the uncertainty in how the well-characterized size distribution for Kuiper belt objects (with impactor diameter d{\textgreater}100km) connects to smaller projectiles, we compute cratering rates using five model impactor size distributions: a single power-law, a power-law with a knee, a power-law with a divot, as well as the “wavy” size distributions described in Minton et al. (Minton, D.A. et al. [2012]. Asteroids Comets Meteors Conf. 1667, 6348) and Schlichting et al. (Schlichting, H.E., Fuentes, C.I., Trilling, D.E. [2013]. Astron. J. 146, 36–42). We find that there is only a small chance that Pluto has been hit in the past 4Gyr by even one impactor with a diameter larger than the known break in the projectile size distribution (d≈100km) which would create a basin on Pluto (D⩾400km in diameter). We show that due to present uncertainties in the impactor size distribution between d=1–100km, computing absolute ages for the surface of Pluto is entirely dependent on the extrapolation to small sizes and thus fraught with uncertainty. We show, however, what the ages would be for several cases and illustrate the relative importance of each Kuiper belt sub-population to the cratering rate, both now and integrated into the past. In addition, we compute the largest “fresh” crater expected to have formed in 1Gyr on the surface of Pluto and in 3Gyr on Charon (to 95{\%} confidence) and use the “wavy” size distribution models to predict whether these largest “fresh” craters will provide surfaces for which portions of the crater production function can be measured should most of the target's surface appear saturated. The fly-through results coupled with telescopic surveys that bridge current uncertainties in the d=10–100km regime should eventually result in the population estimate uncertainties for the Kuiper belt sub-populations, and thus the impact fluxes onto Pluto and Charon, dipping to {\textless}30{\%}. We also compute “disruption timescales” (to a factor of three accuracy) for Pluto's smaller satellites: Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. We find that none of the four satellites have likely undergone a catastrophic disruption and reassembly event in the past ≈4Gyr. In addition, we find that for a knee size distribution with $\alpha$faint⩽0.4 (down to sub-km diameters), satellites of all sizes are able to survive catastrophic disruption over the past 4Gyr.},

abstract = {We discuss the reverse sprinkler problem: How does a sprinkler turn when submerged and made to suck in water? We propose a solution that requires only a knowledge of mechanics and fluid dynamics at the introductory university level. We argue that as the flow of water starts, the sprinkler briefly experiences a torque that would make it turn toward the incoming water, while as the flow of water ceases it briefly experiences a torque in the opposite direction. No torque is expected when water is flowing steadily into it unless dissipative effects, such as viscosity, are considered. Dissipative effects result in a small torque that would cause the sprinkler arm to accelerate toward the steadily incoming water. Our conclusions are discussed in light of an analysis of forces, conservation of angular momentum, and the experimental results reported by others. We review the conflicting published treatments of this problem, some of which have been incorrect and many of which have introduced complications that obscure the basic physics involved.},

abstract = {We show, by comparing observations with theoretical models, that the observed Kuiper Belt size distribution is well matched by coagulation models, which start from an initial planetesimal population with radii of about 1km, and subsequent collisional evolution. We find that the observed size distribution for R {\textgreater} 30km has not been modified by collisional evolution over the age of the solar system, and that the size distribution below R {\~{}} 30km has been modified by collisions and that its slope is well matched by collisional evolution models that use published strength laws. We investigate in detail the resulting size distribution of bodies ranging from 0.01km to 30km and find that its slope changes several times as a function of radius before approaching the expected value for an equilibrium collisional cascade of material strength dominated bodies for R {\textless} 0.1km. Compared to a single power law size distribution that would span the whole range from 0.01km to 30km, we find a strong deficit of bodies around R {\~{}}10km and a strong excess of bodies around 2km. This deficit and excess are caused by an excess mass in small planetesimals in the km size range that was left over from the runaway growth phase and that leaves a signature in the size distribution that is not erased after 4.5 Gyrs of collisional evolution. Observations of the small KBO size distribution can therefore test if large KBOs grew as a result of runaway growth and constrain the initial planetesimal sizes. We find that results from recent KBO occultation surveys and the observed KBO size distribution can be best matched by an initial planetesimal population that contained about equal mass per logarithmic mass bin in bodies ranging from 0.4km to 4km in radius. In addition, we find that we cannot match the observed KBO size distribution if most of the planetesimal mass was contained in bodies that were 10km in radius or larger.},

abstract = {The moment of inertia of a giant planet reveals important information about the planet's internal density structure and this information is not identical to that contained in the gravitational moments. The forthcoming Juno mission to Jupiter might determine Jupiter's normalized moment of inertia NMoI=C/MR2 by measuring Jupiter's pole precession and the Lense-Thirring acceleration of the spacecraft (C is the axial moment of inertia, and M and R are Jupiter's mass and mean radius, respectively). We investigate the possible range of NMoI values for Jupiter based on its measured gravitational field using a simple core/envelope model of the planet assuming that J2 and J4 are perfectly known and are equal to their measured values. The model suggests that for fixed values of J2 and J4 a range of NMoI values between 0.2629 and 0.2645 can be found. The Radau-Darwin relation gives a NMoI value that is larger than the model values by less than 1{\%}. A low NMoI of ∼0.236, inferred from a dynamical model (Ward, W.R., Canup, R.M. [2006]. Astrophys. J. 640, L91-L94) is inconsistent with this range, but the range is model dependent. Although we conclude that the NMoI is tightly constrained by the gravity coefficients, a measurement of Jupiter's NMoI to a few tenths of percent by Juno could provide an important constraint on Jupiter's internal structure. We carry out a simplified assessment of the error involved in Juno's possible determination of Jupiter's NMoI. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Prior models of lunar-forming impacts assume that both the impactor and the target protoearth were not rotating prior to the Moon-forming event. However, planet formation models suggest that such objects would have been rotating rapidly during the late stages of terrestrial accretion. In this paper I explore the effects of pre-impact rotation on impact outcomes through more than 100 hydrodynamical simulations that consider a range of impactor masses, impact angles and impact speeds. Pre-impact rotation, particularly in the target protoearth, can substantially alter collisional outcomes and leads to a more diverse set of final planet-disk systems than seen previously. However, the subset of these impacts that are also lunar-forming candidates-i.e. that produce a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk-have properties similar to those determined for collisions of non-rotating objects [Canup, R.M., Asphaug, E., 2001. Nature 412, 708-712; Canup, R.M., 2004a. Icarus 168, 433-456]. With or without pre-impact rotation, a lunar-forming impact requires an impact angle near 45 degrees, together with a low impact velocity that is not more than 10{\%} larger than the Earth's escape velocity, and produces a disk containing up to about two lunar masses that is composed predominantly of material originating from the impactor. The most significant differences in the successful cases involving pre-impact spin occur for impacts into a retrograde rotating protoearth, which allow for larger impactors (containing up to 20{\%} of Earth's mass) and provide an improved match with the current Earth-Moon system angular momentum compared to prior results. The most difficult state to reconcile with the Moon is that of a rapidly spinning, low-obliquity protoearth before the giant impact, as these cases produce disks that are not massive enough to yield the Moon. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Feroz2008,
abstract = {In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficult problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional MCMC sampling methods. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), has greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but their implementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced degeneracies. Shaw et al. (2007), recently introduced a clustered nested sampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the final evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further increase in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from distributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies; we also present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement in sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to toy problems to demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian object detection in astronomical datasets.},

abstract = {APPROXIMATELY ten per cent of the impact structures on the Earth and Venus are doublets RF 1,2 - pairs of craters formed by the near-simultaneous impact of asteroids of comparable size. It has been suggested that these doublet craters form from asteroid fragments dispersed by aerodynamic forces during atmospheric entry 1,3, or from asteroids that were tidally disrupted by gravitational forces shortly before impact 4-6. But to form a doublet, the progenitors of the craters must have been well separated before final impact 1, which poses problems for both mechanisms. Here we argue that a hitherto undetected population of well separated binary asteroids can explain the occurrence of doublet craters. By modelling asteroids as weak, gravitationally bound aggregates ('rubble piles'), we show that the tidal forces experienced during close encounters with the Earth can generate binary asteroids, in a process similar to that which fragmented the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 7) as it passed by Jupiter. Although the resulting binary asteroids may eventually separate or coalesce before colliding with a planet, repeated close encounters with the Earth maintain a steady-state population that is sufficiently large to explain the observed number of doublet craters.},

abstract = {A few years ago, Hubbard (2012, 2013) presented an elegant, non-perturbative method, called concentric MacLaurin spheroid (CMS), to calculate with very high accuracy the gravitational moments of a rotating fluid body following a barotropic pressure-density relationship. Having such an accurate method is of great importance for taking full advantage of the Juno mission, and its extremely precise determination of Jupiter gravitational moments, to better constrain the internal structure of the planet. Recently, several authors have applied this method to the Juno mission with 512 spheroids linearly spaced in altitude. We demonstrate in this paper that such calculations lead to errors larger than Juno's error bars, invalidating the aforederived Jupiter models at the level required by Juno's precision. We show that, in order to fulfill Juno's observational constraints, at least 1500 spheroids must be used with a cubic, square or exponential repartition, the most reliable solutions. When using a realistic equation of state instead of a polytrope, we highlight the necessity to properly describe the outermost layers to derive an accurate boundary condition, excluding in particular a zero pressure outer condition. Providing all these constraints are fulfilled, the CMS method can indeed be used to derive Jupiter models within Juno's present observational constraints. However, we show that the treatment of the outermost layers leads to irreducible errors in the calculation of the gravitational moments and thus on the inferred physical quantities for the planet. We have quantified these errors and evaluated the maximum precision that can be reached with the CMS method in the present and future exploitation of Juno's data.},

abstract = {The South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin is the largest and oldest definitive impact structure on the Moon. To understand how this immense basin formed, we conducted a suite of SPA-scale numerical impact simulations varying impactor size, impact velocity, and lithospheric thermal gradient. We compared our model results to observational SPA basin data to constrain a best-fit scenario for the SPA basin-forming impact. Our results show that the excavation depth-to-diameter ratio for SPA-scale impacts is constant for all impact scenarios and is consistent with analytical and geological estimates of excavation depth in smaller craters, suggesting that SPA-scale impacts follow proportional scaling. Steep near-surface thermal gradients and high internal temperatures greatly affected the basin-forming process, basin structure and impact-generated melt volume. In agreement with previous numerical studies of SPA-scale impacts, crustal material is entirely removed from the basin center which is instead occupied by a large melt pool of predominantly mantle composition. Differentiation of the melt pool is needed to be consistent with observational data. Assuming differentiation of the thick impact-generated melt sheet occurred, and using observational basin data as constraints, we find the best-fit impact scenario for the formation of the South Pole-Aitken basin to be an impact with an energy of {\~{}}4×10 26J (our specific model considered an impactor 170km in diameter, striking at 10km/s). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Planetary formation theories suggest that the giant planets formed on circular and coplanar orbits. The eccentricities of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, however, reach values of 6 per cent, 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of approximately 2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals. Our model reproduces all the important characteristics of the giant planets' orbits, namely their final semimajor axes, eccentricities and mutual inclinations.},

The models are constrained by the observed mass, rotation rate, radius, and gravitational moments of the two planets. New models with a composition gradient in the outer third of the planetary radius are found for both planets. Such composition gradients may play a significant role in controlling the internal heat flow. In agreement with previous models, we find that the pressure-density relation for the central third of both planets is consistent with either ice or a mixture of materials with a similar equation of state. While the range of allowed models is now somewhat greater, the principal conclusions drawn from traditional interior modeling techniques are robust.},

abstract = {Terrestrial planet formation is believed to have concluded in our Solar System with about 10 million to 100 million years of giant impacts, where hundreds of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos acquired random velocities through gravitational encounters and resonances with one another and with Jupiter. This led to planet-crossing orbits and collisions that produced the four terrestrial planets, the Moon and asteroids. But here we show that colliding planets do not simply merge, as is commonly assumed. In many cases, the smaller planet escapes from the collision highly deformed, spun up, depressurized from equilibrium, stripped of its outer layers, and sometimes pulled apart into a chain of diverse objects. Remnants of these 'hit-and-run' collisions are predicted to be common among remnant planet-forming populations, and thus to be relevant to asteroid formation and meteorite petrogenesis.},

A clear correlation emerges between the planetary heavy element mass {\$}M{\_}z{\$} and the total planet mass, approximately of the form {\$}M{\_}z \backslashpropto \backslashsqrt{\{}M{\}}{\$}. This finding is consistent with the core accretion model of planet formation. We also study how stellar metallicity [Fe/H] affects planetary metal-enrichment and find a weaker correlation than has been previously reported from studies with smaller sample sizes. We confirm a strong relationship between the planetary metal-enrichment relative to the parent star {\$}Z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm planet{\}}/Z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm star{\}}{\$} and the planetary mass, but see no relation in {\$}Z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm planet{\}}/Z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm star{\}}{\$} with planet orbital properties or stellar mass.

abstract = {A continuum description of granular flows would be of considerable help in predicting natural geophysical hazards or in designing industrial processes. However, the constitutive equations for dry granular flows, which govern how the material moves under shear, are still a matter of debate. One difficulty is that grains can behave like a solid (in a sand pile), a liquid (when poured from a silo) or a gas (when strongly agitated). For the two extreme regimes, constitutive equations have been proposed based on kinetic theory for collisional rapid flows, and soil mechanics for slow plastic flows. However, the intermediate dense regime, where the granular material flows like a liquid, still lacks a unified view and has motivated many studies over the past decade. The main characteristics of granular liquids are: a yield criterion (a critical shear stress below which flow is not possible) and a complex dependence on shear rate when flowing. In this sense, granular matter shares similarities with classical visco-plastic fluids such as Bingham fluids. Here we propose a new constitutive relation for dense granular flows, inspired by this analogy and recent numerical and experimental work. We then test our three-dimensional (3D) model through experiments on granular flows on a pile between rough sidewalls, in which a complex 3D flow pattern develops. We show that, without any fitting parameter, the model gives quantitative predictions for the flow shape and velocity profiles. Our results support the idea that a simple visco-plastic approach can quantitatively capture granular flow properties, and could serve as a basic tool for modelling more complex flows in geophysical or industrial applications.},

The coupling parameter concept is defined mathematically as the measure that governs limit point source solutions. Examples of cases where coupling parameters are used are presented. The relationships of the coupling parameter concept with steady flow and the Z-model of cratering of Maxwell (1973, 1977) are studied. Crater size, ejecta distributions, growth histories, time of formation, melt volume, and shock decay for various scale factors for impact cratering mechanics are calculated, and the applicability of the coupling parameter to the study of cratering mechanics is revealed.},

abstract = {Hydrogen and helium demix when sufficiently cool, and this bears on the evolution of all giant planets at large separations at or below roughly a Jupiter mass. We model the thermal evolution of Jupiter, including its evolving helium distribution following results of ab initio simulations for helium immiscibility in metallic hydrogen. After 4 Gyr of homogeneous evolution, differentiation establishes a thin helium gradient below 1 Mbar that dynamically stabilizes the fluid to convection. The region undergoes overstable double-diffusive convection (ODDC), whose weak heat transport maintains a superadiabatic temperature gradient. With a generic parameterization for the ODDC efficiency, the models can reconcile Jupiter's intrinsic flux, atmospheric helium content, and radius at the age of the solar system if the Lorenzen et al. H-He phase diagram is translated to lower temperatures. We cast the evolutionary models in an MCMC framework to explore tens of thousands of evolutionary sequences, retrieving probability distributions for the total heavy element mass, the superadiabaticity of the temperature gradient due to ODDC, and the phase diagram perturbation. The adopted SCvH-I equation of state favors inefficient ODDC such that a thermal boundary layer is formed, allowing the molecular envelope to cool rapidly while the deeper interior actually heats up over time. If the overall cooling time is modulated with an additional free parameter to imitate the effect of a colder or warmer EOS, the models favor those that are colder than SCvH-I. In this case the superadiabaticity is modest and a warming or cooling deep interior are equally likely.},

abstract = {We present further development and the first public release of our multimodal nested sampling algorithm, called MultiNest. This Bayesian inference tool calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions. The developments presented here lead to further substantial improvements in sampling efficiency and robustness, as compared to the original algorithm presented in Feroz {\&} Hobson (2008), which itself significantly outperformed existing MCMC techniques in a wide range of astrophysical inference problems. The accuracy and economy of the MultiNest algorithm is demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focussing on the extension of the vanilla {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MultiNest software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to CosmoMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/. It will also be released as part of the SuperBayeS package, for the analysis of supersymmetric theories of particle physics, at http://www.superbayes.org},

@article{Fortney2007,
abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90{\%} of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If "hot Neptunes" have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of {\~{}}0.30-0.45 R J are expected. Water planets are {\~{}}40{\%}-50{\%} larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler .},

abstract = {The Moon is generally believed to have formed from debris ejected by a large off-centre collision with the early Earth. The impact orientation and size are constrained by the angular momentum contained in both the Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit, a quantity that has been nearly conserved over the past 4.5 billion years. Simulations of potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient to study the production of bound debris. However, identifying impacts capable of yielding the Earth-Moon system has proved difficult. Previous works found that forming the Moon with an appropriate impact angular momentum required the impact to occur when the Earth was only about half formed, a more restrictive and problematic model than that originally envisaged. Here we report a class of impacts that yield an iron-poor Moon, as well as the current masses and angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. This class of impacts involves a smaller-and thus more likely-object than previously considered viable, and suggests that the Moon formed near the very end of Earth's accumulation.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that many kilometer-sized bodies in the Solar System are piles of rubble bound together by gravity. We present results from a project to map the parameter space of collisions between kilometer-sized spherical rubble piles. The results will assist in parameterization of collision outcomes for Solar System formation models and give insight into disruption scaling laws. We use a direct numerical method to evolve the positions and velocities of the rubble pile particles under the constraints of gravity and physical collisions. We test the dependence of the collision outcomes on impact parameter and speed, impactor spin, mass ratio, and coefficient of restitution. Speeds are kept low ({\textless}10 m s−1, appropriate for dynamically cool systems such as the primordial disk during early planet formation) so that the maximum strain on the component material does not exceed the crushing strength, assuming sufficient granularity. We compare our results with analytic estimates and hydrocode simulations. We find that net accretion dominates the outcome in slow head-on collisions while net erosion dominates for fast off-axis collisions. The dependence on impact parameter is almost equally as important as the dependence on impact speed. Off-axis collisions can result in fast-spinning elongated remnants or contact binaries while fast collisions result in smaller fragments overall. Clumping of debris escaping from the remnant can occur, leading to the formation of smaller rubble piles. In the cases we tested, less than 2{\%} of the system mass ends up orbiting the remnant. Initial spin can reduce or enhance collision outcomes, depending on the relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momenta. We derive a relationship between impact speed and angle for critical dispersal of mass in the system. We find that our rubble piles are relatively easy to disperse, even at low impact speed. This may provide a way of constraining the energy dissipation parameter and related properties of the initial planetesimal population.},

abstract = {The present size frequency distribution (SFD) of bodies in the asteroid belt appears to have preserved some record of the primordial population, with an excess of bodies of diameter D???. 100 km relative to a simple power law. The survival of Vesta's basaltic crust also implies that the early SFD had a shallow slope in the range ???10-100 km. (Morbidelli, A., Bottke, W.F., Nesvorny, D., Levison, H.F. [2009]. Icarus 204, 558-573) were unable to produce these features by accretion from an initial population of km-sized planetesimals. They concluded that bodies with sizes in the range ???100-1000 km and a SFD similar to the current population were produced directly from solid particles of sub-meter scale, without experiencing accretion through intermediate sizes. We present results of new accretion simulations in the primordial asteroid region. The requisite SFD can be produced from an initial population of planetesimals of sizes ???0.1. km, smaller than the usual assumption of km-sized bodies. The bump at D???. 100 km is produced by a transition from dispersion-dominated runaway growth to a regime dominated by Keplerian shear, before the formation of large protoplanetary embryos. Thus, accretion of the asteroids from an initial population of small (sub-km) planetesimals cannot be ruled out. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {New interior models for Jupiter and Saturn are described that do not assume the temperature profiles to be adiabatic throughtout the entire hydrogen-helium envelope. These models include the recently calculated radiative opacities due to hydrogen, helium, water, methane, and ammonia and an up-to-date hydrogen/helium equation of state. The helium abundnace in the planet, the mass of the core, and the discontinuity of helium abundance at the molecular/metallic hydrogen phase transition (or the ice fraction in the core) are optimized to reproduce the observed mass, radius, and gravitational moments within their error bars. These nonadiabatic models are characterized by the presence of a radiative zone in the outermost layers of the planet, surrounded by two convective zones. This radiative window yields a substantial modification of the thermal properties of the planets and leads to cooler interior models. The mass of Jupiter core is found to be slightly larger than for the adiabatic models. Finally, the mass fractions of heavy elements deduced from our calculations are in better agreement with the values inferred from atmospheric measurements.},

abstract = {Recent formation and structure models of Jupiter suggest that the planet can have composition gradients and not be fully convective (adiabatic). This possibility directly affects our understanding of Jupiter's bulk composition and origin. In this Letter we present Jupiter's evolution with a primordial structure consisting of a relatively steep heavy-element gradient of 40 Earth masses. We show that for a primordial structure with composition gradients, most of the mixing occurs in the outer part of the gradient during the early evolution (several 10{\^{}}7 years), leading to an adiabatic outer envelope (60{\%} of Jupiter's mass). We find that the composition gradient in the deep interior persists, suggesting that about 40{\%} of Jupiter's mass can be non-adiabatic with a higher temperature than the one derived from Jupiter's atmospheric properties. The region that can potentially develop layered-convection in Jupiter today is estimated to be limited to about 10{\%} of the mass.},

abstract = {The barrage of comets and asteroids that produced many young lunar basins (craters over 300 kilometres in diameter) has frequently been called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Many assume the LHB ended about 3.7 to 3.8 billion years (Gyr) ago with the formation of Orientale basin. Evidence for LHB-sized blasts on Earth, however, extend into the Archaean and early Proterozoic eons, in the form of impact spherule beds: globally distributed ejecta layers created by Chicxulub-sized or larger cratering events4. At least seven spherule beds have been found that formed between 3.23 and 3.47 Gyr ago, four between 2.49 and 2.63 Gyr ago, and one between 1.7 and 2.1 Gyr ago. Here we report that the LHB lasted much longer than previously thought, with most late impactors coming from the E belt, an extended and now largely extinct portion of the asteroid belt between 1.7 and 2.1 astronomical units from Earth. This region was destabilized by late giant planet migration. E-belt survivors now make up the high-inclination Hungaria asteroids. Scaling from the observed Hungaria asteroids, we find that E-belt projectiles made about ten lunar basins between 3.7 and 4.1 Gyr ago. They also produced about 15 terrestrial basins between 2.5 and 3.7 Gyr ago, as well as around 70 and four Chicxulub-sized or larger craters on the Earth and Moon, respectively, between 1.7 and 3.7 Gyr ago. These rates reproduce impact spherule bed and lunar crater constraints.},

@article{Lubbad2011,
abstract = {A ship advancing in level ice will introduce several failure processes to the ice sheet, such as localised crushing and breaking due to bending stresses. The resulting ice fragments will interact with each other, with water and with the hull of the ship. They may rotate, collide, or slide along ship's hull, and eventually they will be cleared away. The situation is different in a broken ice field, i.e., large ice floes may behave similar to level ice while smaller floes will mostly be pushed aside, rotated or submerged. Modelling of such a complex system is very demanding and often computationally expensive which would typically hinder the chances for real-time simulations. This kind of simulations can be very useful for training personnel for Arctic offshore operations and procedures, for analysing the efficiency of various ice management concepts and as a part of the onboard support systems for station keeping. The challenge of meeting the real-time criterion is overcome in the present paper. The paper describes a numerical model to simulate the process of ship–ice interaction in real-time. New analytical closed form solutions are established and used to represent the ice breaking process. PhysX is used for the first time to solve the equations of rigid body motions in 6 degrees of freedom for all ice floes in the calculation domain. The results of the simulator are validated against experimental data from model-scale and full-scale tests. The validation tests exhibited a satisfactory agreement between the model calculations and experimental measurements.},

abstract = {We present results of modeling rubble piles as collections of polyhedra. The use of polyhedra allows more realistic (irregular) shapes and interactions (e.g. collisions), particularly for objects of different sizes. Rotational degrees of freedom are included in the modeling, which may be important components of the motion. We solved the equations of rigid-body dynamics, including frictional/inelastic collisions, for collections of up to several hundred elements. As a demonstration of the methods and to compare with previous work by other researchers, we simulated low-speed collisions between km-scale bodies with the same general parameters as those simulated by Leinhardt et al. [Leinhardt, Z.M., Richardson, D.C., Quinn, T., 2000. Icarus 146, 133–151]. High-speed collisions appropriate to present-day asteroid encounters require additional treatment of shock effects and fragmentation and are the subject of future work; here we study regimes appropriate to planetesimal accretion and re-accretion in the aftermath of catastrophic events. Collisions between equal-mass objects at low speeds () were simulated for both head-on and off-center collisions between rubble piles made of a power-law mass spectrum of sub-elements. Very low-speed head-on collisions produce single objects from the coalescence of the impactors. For slightly higher speeds, extensive disruption occurs, but re-accretion produces a single object with most of the total mass. For increasingly higher speeds, the re-accreted object has smaller mass, finally resulting in complete catastrophic disruption with all sub-elements on escape trajectories and only small amounts of mass in re-accreted bodies. Off-center collisions at moderately low speeds produce two re-accreted objects of approximately equal mass, separating at greater than escape speed. At high speed, complete disruption occurs as with the high-speed head-on collisions. Head-on collisions at low to moderate speeds result in objects of mostly oblate shape, while higher speed collisions produce mostly prolate objects, as do off-center collisions at moderate and high speeds. Collisions carried out with the same dissipative coefficients (coefficient of restitution n=0.8, zero friction) as used by Leinhardt et al. [Leinhardt, Z.M., Richardson, D.C., Quinn, T., 2000. Icarus 146, 133–151] result in a value for specific energy for disruption , somewhat lower than the value of 2 J/kg found by them, while collisions with a lower coefficient of restitution and friction [n=0.5, t=0, $\mu$=0.5, similar to those used by Michel, et al.

abstract = {The Juno mission set out to probe the hidden properties of Jupiter, such as its gravitational field, the depth of its atmospheric jets and its composition beneath the clouds. A collection of papers in this week's issue report some of the mission's key findings. Jupiter's gravitational field varies from pole to pole, but the cause of this asymmetry is unknown. Rotating planets that are squashed at the poles like Jupiter can have a gravity field that is characterized by a solid-body component, plus components that arise from motions in the atmosphere. Luciano Iess and colleagues use Juno's Doppler tracking data to determine Jupiter's gravity harmonics. They find that the north–south asymmetry arises from atmospheric and interior wind flows. To determine the depths of these flows, Yohai Kaspi and colleagues analyse the odd gravitational harmonics and find that the J3, J5, J7 and J9 harmonics are consistent with the jets extending deep into the atmosphere, perhaps as far as 3,000 kilometres. They conclude that the mass of Jupiter's dynamical atmosphere is about one per cent of Jupiter's total mass. The composition of Jupiter beneath its turbulent atmosphere remains a mystery. If different parts of a spinning object rotate at different rates, then the object probably has a fluid composition. Tristan Guillot and colleagues study the even gravitational harmonics and find that, below a depth of about 3,000 kilometres, Jupiter is rotating almost as a solid body. The atmospheric zonal flows extend downwards by more than 2,000 kilometres, but not beyond 3,500 kilometres, as is also the case with the jets.},

These can be used to better determine Jupiter's internal density profile and constrain its core mass. Yet the largest unknown on these gravity moments comes from the effect of differential rotation, which gives a degree of freedom unaccounted for by internal structure models. Here considering a wide range of possible internal flow structures and dynamical considerations, we provide upper bounds to the effect of dynamics (differential rotation) on the low-degree gravity moments. In light of the recent Juno gravity measurements and their small uncertainties, this allows differentiating between the various models suggested for Jupiter's internal structure.},

abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, SPH, and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume 'overlap.' We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity {\&} cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO: this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' {\&} numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, {\&} sharp shock-capturing. Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors {\&} numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.' These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

@article{Canup2010,
abstract = {The origin of Saturn's rings has not been adequately explained. The current rings are more than 90 to 95 per cent water ice, which implies that initially they were almost pure ice because they are continually polluted by rocky meteoroids. In contrast, a half-rock, half-ice mixture (similar to the composition of many of the satellites in the outer Solar System) would generally be expected. Previous ring origin theories invoke the collisional disruption of a small moon, or the tidal disruption of a comet during a close passage by Saturn. These models are improbable and/or struggle to account for basic properties of the rings, including their icy composition. Saturn has only one large satellite, Titan, whereas Jupiter has four large satellites; additional large satellites probably existed originally but were lost as they spiralled into Saturn. Here I report numerical simulations of the tidal removal of mass from a differentiated, Titan-sized satellite as it migrates inward towards Saturn. Planetary tidal forces preferentially strip material from the satellite's outer icy layers, while its rocky core remains intact and is lost to collision with the planet. The result is a pure ice ring much more massive than Saturn's current rings. As the ring evolves, its mass decreases and icy moons are spawned from its outer edge with estimated masses consistent with Saturn's ice-rich moons interior to and including Tethys.},

Participating teams were provided the same likelihood function and set of priors to use in their analysis. They applied a variety of methods to estimate {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}Z{\}}{\}}{\$}, the marginal likelihood for each {\$}n{\$}-planet model, including cross-validation, the Laplace approximation, importance sampling, and nested sampling. We found the dispersion in {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}Z{\}}{\}}{\$} across different methods grew with increasing {\$}n{\$}-planet models: {\$}\backslashsim\backslash,{\$}3 for 0-planets, {\$}\backslashsim\backslash,{\$}10 for 1-planet, {\$}\backslashsim\backslash,{\$}{\$}10{\^{}}2{\$}-{\$}10{\^{}}3{\$} for 2-planets, and {\$}{\textgreater}\backslash,{\$}{\$}10{\^{}}4{\$} for 3-planets. Most internal estimates of uncertainty in {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}Z{\}}{\}}{\$} for individual methods significantly underestimated the observed dispersion across all methods. Methods that adopted a Monte Carlo approach by comparing estimates from multiple runs yielded plausible uncertainties. Finally, two classes of numerical algorithms (those based on importance and nested samplers) arrived at similar conclusions regarding the ratio of {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}Z{\}}{\}}{\$}s for {\$}n{\$} and ({\$}n+1{\$})-planet models. One analytic method (the Laplace approximation) demonstrated comparable performance. We express both optimism and caution: we demonstrate that it is practical to perform rigorous Bayesian model comparison for {\$}\backslashleq{\$}3-planet models, yet robust planet discoveries require researchers to better understand the uncertainty in {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}Z{\}}{\}}{\$} and its connections to model selection. Future research should address greater {\$}n{\$}-planet models, RVs with stellar activity indicators, and many more simulated datasets with a wider range of planet and noise properties.},

Saturn's atmosphere has numerous, low-contrast, discrete cloud features and a pattern of circulation significantly different from that of Jupiter. Titan is shrouded in a haze layer that varies in thickness and appearance. Among the icy satellites there is considerable variety in density, albedo, and surface morphology and substantial evidence for endogenic surface modification. Trends in density and crater characteristics are quite unlike those of the Galilean satellites. Small inner satellites, three of which were discovered in Voyager images, interact gravitationally with one another and with the ring particles in ways not observed elsewhere in the solar system. Saturn's broad A, B, and C rings contain hundreds of "ringlets," and in the densest portion of the B ring there are numerous nonaxisymmetric features. The narrow F ring has three components which, in at least one instance, are kinked and crisscrossed. Two rings are observed beyond the F ring, and material is seen between the C ring and the planet.},

abstract = {Our knowledge of the strengths of small bodies in the Solar System is limited by our poor understanding of their internal structures, and this, in turn, clouds our understanding of the formation and evolution of these bodies. Observations of the rotational states of asteroids whose diameters are larger than a few hundreds of meters have revealed that they are dominated by gravity and that most are unlikely to be monoliths; however, there is a wide range of plausible internal structures. Numerical and analytical studies of shape and spin limits of gravitational aggregates and their collisional evolution show a strong dependence on shear strength. In order to study this effect, we carry out a systematic exploration of the dependence of collision outcomes on dissipation and friction parameters of the material components making up the bodies. We simulate the catastrophic disruption (leading to the largest remnant retaining 50{\%} of the original mass) of km-size asteroids modeled as gravitational aggregates using pkdgrav, a cosmology N-body code adapted to collisional problems and recently enhanced with a new soft-sphere collision algorithm that includes more realistic contact forces. We find that for a range of three different materials, higher friction and dissipation values increase the catastrophic disruption threshold by about half a magnitude. Furthermore, we find that pre-impact rotation systematically increases mass loss on average, regardless of the target's internal configuration. Our results have important implications for the efficiency of planet formation via planetesimal growth, and also more generally to estimate the impact energy threshold for catastrophic disruption, as this generally has only been evaluated for non-spinning bodies without detailed consideration of material properties. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {In the giant-impact hypothesis for lunar origin, the Moon accreted from an equatorial circum-terrestrial disk; however, the current lunar orbital inclination of five degrees requires a subsequent dynamical process that is still unclear1–3. In addition, the giant- impact theory has been challenged by the Moon's unexpectedly Earth-like isotopic composition4,5. Here we show that tidal dissipation due to lunar obliquity was an important effect during the Moon's tidal evolution, and the lunar inclination in the past must have been very large, defying theoretical explanations. We present a tidal evolution model starting with the Moon in an equatorial orbit around an initially fast-spinning, high-obliquity Earth, which is a probable outcome of giant impacts. Using numerical modelling, we show that the solar perturbations on the Moon's orbit naturally induce a large lunar inclination and remove angular momentum from the Earth–Moon system. Our tidal evolution model supports recent high-angular-momentum, giant-impact scenarios to explain the Moon's isotopic composition6–8 and provides a new pathway to reach Earth's climatically favourable low obliquity.},

abstract = {Impact cratering creates a wide range of topography on small satellites and asteroids. The population of visible craters evolves with impacts, and because there are no competing endogenic processes to modify the surface, determining the various ways younger craters add to or subtract from the population is a fundamental aspect of small-body geology. Asteroid 433 Eros, the most closely studied small body, has regions of substantially different crater densities that remain unexplained. Here we show that the formation of a relatively young crater (7.6 km in diameter) resulted in the removal of other craters as large as 0.5 km over nearly 40 percent of the asteroid. Burial by ejecta cannot explain the observed pattern of crater removal. The limitation of reduced crater density to a zone within a particular straight-line distance through the asteroid from the centre of the large crater suggests degradation of the topography by seismic energy released during the impact. Our observations indicate that the interior of Eros is sufficiently cohesive to transmit seismic energy over many kilometres, and the outer several tens of metres of the asteroid must be composed of relatively non-cohesive material.},

This questionable expansion, when integrated, leads to the standard geophysical expansion of the external gravitational potential on spherical-harmonics (via the usual J-coefficients). We show that this expansion is convergent and exact on the planet's level surfaces, provided that rotational distortion does not exceed a critical value. We examine the general properties of the Maclaurin multipole expansion and discuss conditions for its convergence on the surface of both single and nested-concentric Maclaurin spheroids.},

abstract = {We perform three-dimensional N-body integrations of the final stages of terrestrial planet formation. We report the results of 10 simulations beginning with 22–50 initial planetary embryos spanning the range 0.5–1.5 AU, each with an initial mass of 0.04–0.13M⊕. Collisions are treated as inelastic mergers. We follow the evolution of each system for 2×108 years at which time a few terrestrial type planets remain. On average, our simulations produced two planets larger than 0.5M⊕ in the terrestrial region (1 simulation with one m≥0.5M⊕ planet, 8 simulations with two m≥0.5M⊕ planets, and 1 simulation with three m≥0.5M⊕ planets). These Earth-like planets have eccentricities and orbital spacing considerably larger than the terrestrial planets of comparable mass (e.g., Earth and Venus). We also examine the angular momentum contributions of each collision to the final spin angular momentum of a planet, with an emphasis on the type of impact which is believed to have triggered the formation of the Earth's Moon. There was an average of two impacts per simulation that contributed more angular momentum to a planet than is currently present in the Earth/Moon system. We determine the spin angular momentum states of the growing planets by summing the contributions from each collisional encounter. Our results show that the spin angular momentum states of the final planets are generally the result of contributions made by the last few large impacts. Our results suggest that the current angular momentum of the Earth/Moon system may be the result of more than one large impact rather than a single impact. Further, upon suffering their first collision, the planetary embryos in our simulations are spinning rapidly throughout the final accretion of the planets, suggesting the proto-Earth may have been rotating rapidly prior to the Moon-forming impact event.},

abstract = {We exploit recent theoretical advances toward the origin and orbital evolution of comets and asteroids to obtain revised estimates for cratering rates in the jovian system. We find that most, probably more than 90{\%}, of the craters on the Galilean satellites are caused by the impact of Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). These are comets with short periods, in generally low-inclination orbits, whose dynamics are dominated by Jupiter. Nearly isotropic comets (long period and Halley-type) contribute at the 1-10{\%} level. Trojan asteroids might also be important at the 1-10{\%} level; if they are important, they would be especially important for smaller craters. Main belt asteroids are currently unimportant, as each 20-km crater made on Ganymede implies the disruption of a 200-km diameter parental asteroid, a destruction rate far beyond the resources of today's asteroid belt. Twenty-kilometer diameter craters are made by kilometer-size impactors; such events occur on a Galilean satellite about once in a million years. The paucity of 20-km craters on Europa indicates that its surface is of order 10 Ma. Lightly cratered surfaces on Ganymede are nominally of order 0.5-1.0 Ga. The uncertainty in these estimates is about a factor of five. Callisto is old, probably more than 4 Ga. It is too heavily cratered to be accounted for by the current flux of JFCs. The lack of pronounced apex-antapex asymmetries on Ganymede may be compatible with crater equilibrium, but it is more easily understood as evidence for nonsynchronous rotation of an icy carapace.},

abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\^{}}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\^{}}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

abstract = {The Cassini measurements of Saturn's gravity field during its Grand Finale might shed light on a long-standing question regarding the flow on Saturn. While the cloud-level winds are well known, little is known about whether these winds are confined to the outer layers of the planet or penetrate deep into the interior. An additional complexity is added by the uncertainty in the exact rotation period of Saturn, a key factor in determining the cloud- level winds, with an effect on the north–south symmetric part of the winds. Using Saturn's cloud-level winds we relate the flow to the gravity harmonics. We give a prediction for the odd harmonics JJ J 35 7,, , and J9 as a function of the flow depth, identifying three ranges of depths. Since the odd harmonics depend solely on the flow, and are not influenced by Saturn's shape and static density distribution, any measured value of the odd harmonics by Cassini can be used to uniquely determine the depth of the flow. We also discuss the flow-induced even harmonics DJJ J,, ,24 12D¼D that are affected by Saturn's rotation period. While the high-degree even harmonics might also be used to determine the flow depth, the lower-degree even harmonics serve as uncertainties for analysis of the planet's interior structure and composition. Thus, the gravity harmonics measured during the Cassini Grand Finale may be used to get a first-order estimate of the flow structure and to better constrain the planet's density structure and composition.},

abstract = {The petrology record on the Moon suggests that a cataclysmic spike in the cratering rate occurred approximately 700 million years after the planets formed; this event is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Planetary formation theories cannot naturally account for an intense period of planetesimal bombardment so late in Solar System history. Several models have been proposed to explain a late impact spike, but none of them has been set within a self-consistent framework of Solar System evolution. Here we propose that the LHB was triggered by the rapid migration of the giant planets, which occurred after a long quiescent period. During this burst of migration, the planetesimal disk outside the orbits of the planets was destabilized, causing a sudden massive delivery of planetesimals to the inner Solar System. The asteroid belt was also strongly perturbed, with these objects supplying a significant fraction of the LHB impactors in accordance with recent geochemical evidence. Our model not only naturally explains the LHB, but also reproduces the observational constraints of the outer Solar System.},

Cooling is regulated post collision by the expansion of the optically thick sheets. on a timescale of hours-days.

abstract = {A common origin for the Moon and Earth is required by their identical isotopic composition. However, simulations of the current giant impact hypothesis for Moon formation find that most lunar material originated from the impactor, which should have had a different isotopic signature. Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to that of the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth's mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon.},

@article{Fujiwara2006,
abstract = {During the interval from September through early December 2005, the Hayabusa spacecraft was in close proximity to near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa, and a variety of data were taken on its shape, mass, and surface topography as well as its mineralogic and elemental abundances. The asteroid's orthogonal axes are 535, 294, and 209 meters, the mass is 3.51 x 10(10) kilograms, and the estimated bulk density is 1.9 +/- 0.13 grams per cubic centimeter. The correspondence between the smooth areas on the surface (Muses Sea and Sagamihara) and the gravitationally low regions suggests mass movement and an effective resurfacing process by impact jolting. Itokawa is considered to be a rubble-pile body because of its low bulk density, high porosity, boulder-rich appearance, and shape. The existence of very large boulders and pillars suggests an early collisional breakup of a preexisting parent asteroid followed by a re-agglomeration into a rubble-pile object.},

abstract = {Voyager 2 images of the southern hemisphere of Uranus indicate that submicrometersize haze particles and particles of a methane condensation cloud produce faint patterns in the atmosphere. The alignment of the cloud bands is similar to that of bands on Jupiter and Saturn, but the zonal winds are nearly opposite. At mid-latitudes (-70 degrees to -27 degrees ), where winds were measured, the atmosphere rotates faster than the magnetic field; however, the rotation rate of the atmosphere decreases toward the equator, so that the two probably corotate at about -20 degrees . Voyager images confirm the extremely low albedo of the ring particles. High phase angle images reveal on the order of 10(2) new ringlike features of very low optical depth and relatively high dust abundance interspersed within the main rings, as well as a broad, diffuse, low optical depth ring just inside the main rings system. Nine of the newly discovered small satellites (40 to 165 kilometers in diameter) orbit between the rings and Miranda; the tenth is within the ring system. Two of these small objects may gravitationally confine the e ring. Oberon and Umbriel have heavily cratered surfaces resembling the ancient cratered highlands of Earth's moon, although Umbriel is almost completely covered with uniform dark material, which perhaps indicates some ongoing process. Titania and Ariel show crater populations different from those on Oberon and Umbriel; these were probably generated by collisions with debris confined to their orbits. Titania and Ariel also show many extensional fault systems; Ariel shows strong evidence for the presence of extrusive material. About halfof Miranda's surface is relatively bland, old, cratered terrain. The remainder comprises three large regions of younger terrain, each rectangular to ovoid in plan, that display complex sets of parallel and intersecting scarps and ridges as well as numerous outcrops of bright and dark materials, perhaps suggesting some exotic composition.},

abstract = {The exact solution for the shape and gravitational field of a rotating two-layer Maclaurin ellipsoid of revolution is compared with predictions of the theory of figures up to third order in the small rotational parameter of the theory of figures. An explicit formula is derived for the external gravitational coefficient J2 of the exact solution. A new approach to the evaluation of the theory of figures based on numerical integration of ordinary differential equations is presented. The classical Radau-Darwin formula is found not to be valid for the rotational parameter ??{\{}lunate{\}}2=??2/(2??G??2)???0.17 since the formula then predicts a surface eccentricity that is smaller than the eccentricity of the core-envelope boundary. Interface eccentricity must be smaller than surface eccentricity. In the formula for ??{\{}lunate{\}}2, ?? is the angular velocity of the two-layer body, ??2 is the density of the outer layer, and G is the gravitational constant. For an envelope density of 3000kgm-3 the failure of the Radau-Darwin formula corresponds to a rotation period of about 3h. Application of the exact solution and the theory of figures is made to models of Earth, Mars, Uranus, and Neptune. The two-layer model with constant densities in the layers can provide realistic approximations to terrestrial planets and icy outer planet satellites. The two-layer model needs to be generalized to allow for a continuous envelope (outer layer) radial density profile in order to realistically model a gas or ice giant planet. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this work we investigate Mercury's formation via giant impacts and consider the possibilities of a single giant impact, a hit-and-run, and multiple collisions in one theoretical framework. We study the standard collision parameters (impact velocity, mass ratio, impact parameter), along with the impactor's composition and the cooling of the target. It is found that the impactor's composition affects the iron distribution within the planet and the final mass of the target by up to 15$\backslash${\%}, although the resulting mean iron fraction is similar. We suggest that an efficient giant impact requires to be head-on with high velocities, while in the hit-and-run case the impact can occur closer to the most probable collision angle (45{\$}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}). It is also shown that Mercury's current iron-to-rock ratio can be a result of multiple-collisions, with their exact number depending on the collision parameters. Mass loss is found to be more significant when the collisions are tight in time.},

abstract = {Impact craters are the most obvious indication of asteroid impacts, but craters on Earth are quickly obscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonic processes. Earth's impact history is inferred therefore either from estimates of the present-day impactor flux as determined by observations of near-Earth asteroids, or from the Moon's incomplete impact chronology. Asteroids hitting Earth typically vaporize a mass of target rock comparable to the projectile's mass. As this vapour expands in a large plume or fireball, it cools and condenses into molten droplets called spherules. For asteroids larger than about ten kilometres in diameter, these spherules are deposited in a global layer. Spherule layers preserved in the geologic record accordingly provide information about an impact even when the source crater cannot be found. Here we report estimates of the sizes and impact velocities of the asteroids that created global spherule layers. The impact chronology from these spherule layers reveals that the impactor flux was significantly higher 3.5 billion years ago than it is now. This conclusion is consistent with a gradual decline of the impactor flux after the Late Heavy Bombardment.},

abstract = {We present the first models of Jupiter and Saturn to couple their evolution to both a radiative-atmosphere grid and to high-pressure phase diagrams of hydrogen with helium and other admixtures. We find that prior calculated phase diagrams in which Saturn's interior reaches a region of predicted helium immiscibility do not allow enough energy release to prolong Saturn's cooling to its known age and effective temperature. We explore modifications to published phase diagrams that would lead to greater energy release, and propose a modified H-He phase diagram that is physically reasonable, leads to the correct extension of Saturn's cooling, and predicts an atmospheric helium mass fraction Yatoms= 0.185, in agreement with recent estimates. We also explore the possibility of internal separation of elements heavier than helium, and find that, alternatively, such separation could prolong Saturn's cooling to its known age and effective temperature under a realistic phase diagram and heavy element abundance (in which case Saturn's Yatomswould be solar but heavier elements would be depleted). In none of these scenarios does Jupiter's interior evolve to any region of helium or heavy-element immiscibility: Jupiter evolves homogeneously to the present day. We discuss the implications of our calculations for Saturn's primordial core mass. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Given their tendency to be incorporated into the core during differentiation, the highly-siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth's mantle are thought to have been accreted as a "late veneer" after the end of the giant impact phase. Bottke et al. (Bottke, W.F., Walker, R.J., Day, J.M.D., Nesvorny, D., Elkins-Tanton, L. [2010]. Science 330, 1527) proposed that the large Earth-to-Moon HSE abundance ratio can be explained if the late veneer was characterized by large (D=1000-4000km) impactors. Here we simulate the evolution of the terrestrial planets during a stochastic late veneer phase from the end of accretion until the start of the late heavy bombardment {\~{}}500Myr later. We show that a late veneer population of 0.05M??? dominated by large (D{\textgreater}1000km) bodies naturally delivers a {\~{}}0.01M??? veneer to Earth, consistent with geochemical constraints. The eccentricities and inclinations of the terrestrial planets are excited by close encounters with the largest late veneer bodies. We find the best agreement with their post-veneer orbits if either (a) the terrestrial planets' pre-veneer angular momentum deficit AMD0 was less than about half of the current one AMDnow, or (b) AMD0???AMDnow and the veneer was limited to smaller (Dmax???2000km) bodies. Veneer impacts on Venus, Earth and Mars were mostly accretionary but on Mercury and the Moon they were mostly erosive. In {\~{}}20{\%} of simulations an energetic impact occurred that could have removed ???25{\%} of Mercury's mass, thereby increasing its iron mass fraction. We show that, due to the erosive nature of larger impacts, the Moon cannot accrete any material from objects larger than 500-1000km. The large Earth-to-Moon HSE abundance ratio is naturally explained if the late veneer included large impactors (D???500-1000km) regardless of their size distribution, as long as most of Earth's veneer came from large bodies. The spin angular moment imparted by stochastic late veneer impacts was far in excess of the current ones for Mercury and Venus, meaning that their post-veneer spin rates were much faster. The late veneer, if it included large impactors, was an accretionary phase for Venus, Earth and Mars but an erosive phase for Mercury and the Moon. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Asteroids with satellites are observed throughout the Solar System, from subkilometre near-Earth asteroid pairs to systems of large and distant bodies in the Kuiper belt. The smallest and closest systems are found among the near-Earth and small inner main-belt asteroids, which typically have rapidly rotating primaries and close secondaries on circular orbits. About 15 per cent of near-Earth and main-belt asteroids with diameters under 10 km have satellites. The mechanism that forms such similar binaries in these two dynamically different populations was hitherto unclear. Here we show that these binaries are created by the slow spinup of a 'rubble pile' asteroid by means of the thermal YORP (Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack) effect. We find that mass shed from the equator of a critically spinning body accretes into a satellite if the material is collisionally dissipative and the primary maintains a low equatorial elongation. The satellite forms mostly from material originating near the primary's surface and enters into a close, low-eccentricity orbit. The properties of binaries produced by our model match those currently observed in the small near-Earth and main-belt asteroid populations, including 1999 KW(4) (refs 3, 4).},

The main originality of CEPAM is the solution of the two point boundary value problem of the quasi-static equilibrium by a collocation implicit method based on piecewise polynomial approximations projected on a B-spline basis. An automatic mesh refinement is designed to adjust the location of the grid points depending on the variation in the unknowns. Moreover, a grid point can be adjusted at any determined position. This allows an exact treatment of the problem, even when the first derivatives of the integration variables (M, R, P, T, L) are discontinuous. A robust optimization method allows the calculation of models matching the observed equatorial radius and gravitational moments. The numerical accuracy of the models calculated is found to be satisfactory even with a small number of mesh points (the relative accuracy is better than 10{\^{}}-5{\^{}} on all the variables with 100 mesh points). The whole precision of models of giant planets is limited by the accuracy of physical data.},

abstract = {Interior models of Jupiter and Saturn are calculated and compared in the framework of the three-layer assumption, which rely on the perception that both planets consist of three globally homogeneous regions: a dense core, a metallic hydrogen envelope, and a molecular hydrogen envelope. Within this framework, constraints on the core mass and abundance of heavy elements (i.e. elements other than hydrogen and helium) are given by accounting for uncertainties on the measured gravitational moments, surface temperature, surface helium abundance, and on the inferred protosolar helium abundance, equations of state, temperature profile and solid/differential interior rotation. Results obtained solely from static models matching the measured gravitational fields indicate that the mass of Jupiter's dense core is less than 14 M⊕ (Earth masses), but that models with no core are possible given the current uncertainties on the hydrogen-helium equation of state. Similarly, Saturn's core mass is less than 22 M⊕ but no lower limit can be inferred. The total mass of heavy elements (including that in the core) is constrained to lie between 11 and 42 M⊕ in Jupiter, and between 19 and 31 M⊕ in Saturn. The enrichment in heavy elements of their molecular envelopes is 1-6.5, and 0.5-12 times the solar value, respectively. Additional constraints from evolution models accounting for the progressive differentiation of helium (Hubbard WB, Guillot T, Marley MS, Burrows A, Lunine JI, Saumon D, 1999. Comparative evolution of Jupiter and Saturn. Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1175-1182) are used to obtain tighter, albeit less robust, constraints. The resulting core masses are then expected to be in the range 0-10 M⊕, and 6-17 M⊕ for Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that Saturn's atmospheric helium mass mixing ratio, as derived from Voyager, Y=0.06+/-0.05, is probably too low. Static and evolution models favor a value of Y=0.11-0.25. Using, Y=0.16+/-0.05, Saturn's molecular region is found to be enriched in heavy elements by 3.5 to 10 times the solar value, in relatively good agreement with the measured methane abundance. Finally, in all cases, the gravitational moment J6 of models matching all the constraints are found to lie between 0.35 and 0.38×10-4 for Jupiter, and between 0.90 and 0.98×10-4 for Saturn, assuming solid rotation. For comparison, the uncertainties on the measured J6 are about 10 times larger. More accurate measurements of J6 (as expected from the Cassini orbiter for Saturn) will therefore permit to test the validity of interior models calculations and the magnitude of differential rotation in the planetary interior.},

@article{SMITH1982,
abstract = {Voyager 2 photography has complemented that of Voyager I in revealing many additional characteristics of Saturn and its satellites and rings. Saturn's atmosphere contains persistent oval cloud features reminiscent of features on Jupiter. Smaller irregular features track out a pattern of zonal winds that is symmetric about Saturn's equator and appears to extend to great depth. Winds are predominantly eastward and reach 500 meters per second at the equator. Titan has several haze layers with significantly varying optical properties and a northern polar "collar" that is dark at short wavelengths. Several satellites have been photographed at substantially improved resolution. Enceladus' surface ranges from old, densely cratered terrain to relatively young, uncratered plains crossed by grooves and faults. Tethys has a crater 400 kilometers in diameter whose floor has domed to match Tethys' surface curvature and a deep trench that extends at least 270° around Tethys' circumference. Hyperion is cratered and irregular in shape. Iapetus' bright, trailing hemisphere includes several dark-floored craters, and Phoebe has a very low albedo and rotates in the direction opposite to that of its orbital revolution with a period of 9 hours. Within Saturn's rings, the "birth" of a spoke has been observed, and surprising azimuthal and time variability is found in the ringlet structure of the outer B ring. These observations lead to speculations about Saturn's internal structure and about the collisional and thermal history of the rings and satellites.},

abstract = {Many asteroids are likely rubble-piles that are a collection of smaller objects held together by gravity and possibly cohesion. These asteroids are seismically shaken by impacts, which leads to excitation of their constituent particles. As a result it has been suggested that their surfaces and sub-surface interiors may be governed by a size sorting mechanism known as the Brazil Nut Effect. We study the behavior of a model asteroid that is a spherical, self-gravitating aggregate with a binary size-distribution of particles under the action of applied seismic shaking. We find that above a seismic threshold, larger particles rise to the surface when friction is present, in agreement with previous studies that focussed on cylindrical and rectangular box configurations. Unlike previous works we also find that size sorting takes place even with zero friction, though the presence of friction does aid the sorting process above the seismic threshold. Additionally we find that while strong size sorting can take place near the surface, the innermost regions remain unsorted under even the most vigorous shaking.},

abstract = {We present a series of computer models for Uranus and Neptune where the interior density distribution is randomly chosen. The only constraints placed on the distribution are that the density does not decrease with decreasing radius, and that the density distribution fits the observed mass and gravitational moments of these planets. Previous models of these planets all had a density discontinuity at about 70{\%} of the total radius. We use our models to explore the space of density distributions that fit the observed gravitational moments, and set limits on the position and size of this discontinuity. We find that models are possible with no discontinuity in the mantle. In addition a density discontinuity as large as 3 g cm-3 is possible for Uranus if the discontinuity is inward of about 0.75 Uranus radii. Closer to the surface the discontinuity must be smaller. For Neptune, the larger uncertainties in the measured moments result in coarser limits on the size of the density jump. Other means of limiting the range of acceptable models are discussed.},

@article{Reinhardt2017,
abstract = {In this paper we present solutions to three short comings of Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics (SPH) encountered in previous work when applying it to Giant Impacts. First we introduce a novel method to obtain accurate SPH representations of a planet's equilibrium initial conditions based on equal area tessellations of the sphere. This allows one to imprint an arbitrary density and internal energy profile with very low noise which substantially reduces computation because these models require no relaxation prior to use. As a consequence one can significantly increase the resolution and more flexibly change the initial bodies to explore larger parts of the impact parameter space in simulations. The second issue addressed is the proper treatment of the matter/vacuum boundary at a planet's surface with a modified SPH density estimator that properly calculates the density stabilizing the models and avoiding an artificially low density atmosphere prior to impact. Further we present a novel SPH scheme that simultaneously conserves both energy and entropy for an arbitrary equation of state. This prevents loss of entropy during the simulation and further assures that the material does not evolve into unphysical states. Application of these modifications to impact simulations for different resolutions up to {\$}6.4 \backslashcdot 10{\^{}}6{\$} particles show a general agreement with prior result. However, we observe resolution dependent differences in the evolution and composition of post collision ejecta. This strongly suggests that the use of more sophisticated equations of state also demands a large number of particles in such simulations.},

abstract = {Like our Moon, the majority of the solar system's satellites are locked in a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance; on average, these satellites show the same face toward the planet at a constant rotation rate equal to the satellite's orbital rate. In addition to the uniform rotational motion, physical librations (oscillations about an equilibrium) also occur. The librations may contain signatures of the satellite's internal properties. Using stereophotogrammetry on Cassini Image Science Subsystem (ISS) images, we measured longitudinal physical forced librations of Saturn's moon Mimas. Our measurements confirm all the libration amplitudes calculated from the orbital dynamics, with one exception. This amplitude depends mainly on Mimas' internal structure and has an observed value of twice the predicted one, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. After considering various possible interior models of Mimas, we argue that the satellite has either a large nonhydrostatic interior, or a hydrostatic one with an internal ocean beneath a thick icy shell.},

abstract = {The tidal interaction of a protoplanet with a circumstellar gaseous disk results in mutual angular momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit of the secondary. There are two, conceptually distinct circumstances wherein nebula torques can cause a secular variation in a protoplanet's semimajor axis. (I) The net torque exerted on a secondary by an undisturbed disk is not, in general, zero. Although gradients in the disk density and temperature can contribute to this torque, it is mostly due to asymmetries in the disk/planet interaction that are inherent to a Keplerian disk. For a relatively thick disk, the differential torque can be a significant fraction of the torque from either its exterior or its interior portion. In this case, the protoplanet drifts relative to disk material on a time scale inversely proportional to its mass. (II) The protoplanet opens a gap in the disk that establishes a flow barrier to disk material. A density discontinuity that locks the protoplanet into the disk's viscous evolution develops across the orbit. The protoplanet migrates on a time scale set by the disk's viscosity. A unified model that clarifies the relationship between these migration types and reveals under what circumstances a given type is selected is presented. In both cases, orbital decay is the prevailing outcome, although type I migration rates can be between one and two orders of magnitudes faster than type II. Estimates of orbital lifetimes are given and are generally shorter than the expected lifetime of the disk. Some implications to the issue of planetary formation are discussed.},

abstract = {We present 'empirical' models (pressure vs. density) of Saturn's interior constrained by the gravitational coefficients J2, J4, and J6for different assumed rotation rates of the planet. The empirical pressure-density profile is interpreted in terms of a hydrogen and helium physical equation of state to deduce the hydrogen to helium ratio in Saturn and to constrain the depth dependence of helium and heavy element abundances. The planet's internal structure (pressure vs. density) and composition are found to be insensitive to the assumed rotation rate for periods between 10h:32m:35s and 10h:41m:35s. We find that helium is depleted in the upper envelope, while in the high pressure region (P ≳ 1 Mbar) either the helium abundance or the concentration of heavier elements is significantly enhanced. Taking the ratio of hydrogen to helium in Saturn to be solar, we find that the maximum mass of heavy elements in Saturn's interior ranges from ∼6 to 20 M⊕. The empirical models of Saturn's interior yield a moment of inertia factor varying from 0.22271 to 0.22599 for rotation periods between 10h:32m:35s and 10h:41m:35s, respectively. A long-term precession rate of about 0.754″ yr-1is found to be consistent with the derived moment of inertia values and assumed rotation rates over the entire range of investigated rotation rates. This suggests that the long-term precession period of Saturn is somewhat shorter than the generally assumed value of 1.77 × 106years inferred from modeling and observations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to {\$}\backslashsim N{\^{}}2{\$} for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space.

Mixtures of hydrogen and helium are obtained with the additive volume rule and an additional ideal entropy-of-mixing term. In this paper, we present extensive tabular results for both the H and He EOS, together with a critical analysis. Part of this analysis is based on a comparison with other EOS commonly used in astrophysics. Both EOS everywhere satisfy the requirements of thermal and mechanical stability and are thermodynamically consistent over most of the phase diagram.

abstract = {We compute grids of radiative-convective model atmospheres for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune over a range of intrinsic fluxes and surface gravities. The atmosphere grids serve as an upper boundary condition for models of the thermal evolution of the planets. Unlike previous work, we customize these grids for the specific properties of each planet, including the appropriate chemical abundances and incident fluxes as a function of solar system age. Using these grids, we compute new models of the thermal evolution of the major planets in an attempt to match their measured luminosities at their known ages. Compared to previous work, we find longer cooling times, predominantly due to higher atmospheric opacity at young ages. For all planets, we employ simple "standard" cooling models that feature adiabatic temperature gradients in the interior H/He and water layers, and an initially hot starting point for the calculation of subsequent cooling. For Jupiter, we find a model cooling age {\~{}}10{\%} longer than previous work, a modest quantitative difference. This may indicate that the hydrogen equation of state used here overestimates the temperatures in the deep interior of the planet. For Saturn, we find a model cooling age {\~{}}20{\%} longer than previous work. However, an additional energy source, such as that due to helium phase separation, is still clearly needed. For Neptune, unlike in work from the 1980s and 1990s, we match the measured T eff of the planet with a model that also matches the planet's current gravity field constraints. This is predominantly due to advances in the high-pressure equation of state of water. This may indicate that the planet possesses no barriers to efficient convection in its deep interior. However, for Uranus, our models exacerbate the well-known problem that Uranus is far cooler than calculations predict, which could imply strong barriers to interior convective cooling. The atmosphere grids are published here as tables, so that they may be used by the wider community.},

abstract = {Comets originated as icy planetesimals in the outer Solar System, as shown by dynamical studies and direct observation of objects in the Kuiper disk. Their nuclei have low strength consistent with “rubble pile” structure and inhomogeneities on scales of tens to hundreds of meters. These properties can be explained by their formation process in the solar nebula. I present results of numerical simulation of the growth of cometesimals, beginning with a uniform mixture of microscopic grains in the nebular gas. Coagulation and settling yield a thin, dense layer of small aggregates in the central plane of the nebula. Shear between this layer and the pressure-supported gas produces turbulence that initially inhibits gravitational instability. Particles grow by collisional coagulation; relative velocities are dominated by radial motion due to orbital decay induced by gas drag. The radial velocity dispersion further delays gravitational instability until the mean particle size reaches tens of meters. Lack of damping in the swarm of macroscopic particles limits gravitational instability to large scales that do not allow collapse to solid bodies. Collisional coagulation is responsible for growth even after instability occurs. The size distribution of cometesimals growing by drag-induced collisions develops a narrow peak in the range tens to hundreds of meters. This occurs because drag-induced velocities decrease with size in this range, while gravitational focusing is negligible. Impact velocities have a minimum at the transition from drag-driven to gravitational accretion at approximately kilometer sizes. Bodies accreted in this manner should have low mechanical strength and macroscopic voids in addition to small-scale porosity. They will be composed of structural elements having a variety of scales, but with some tendency for preferential sizes in the range 10–100 m. These properties are in good agreement with inferred properties of comets, which may preserve a physical record of their accretion.},

The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a rotating planet is solved under these restrictive assumptions, and the effect of the hypothesized rotation state on the planet's gravity harmonics and external shape is investigated. Spacecraft data on zonal currents are used to derive nearly model-independent corrections to the first four zonal gravity harmonic coefficients, which can be used to correct observed gravity harmonics to values appropriate for solid-body rotation. If the assumed rotation state is applicable, then zonal currents lead to measurable topography of isopycnic surfaces with respect to the reference fihure defined by the magnetospheric rotation period and the gravity harmonics. The amplitude of the topography is on the order of 5 km for Jupiter and 60 km for Saturn. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Let pi(w), i = 1, 2, be two densities with common support where each density is known up to a normalizing constant: pi(w) = qi(w)/ci. We have draws from each density (e.g., via Markov chain Monte Carlo), and we want to use these draws to simulate the ratio of the normalizing constants, c1/c2. Such a computational problem is often encountered in likelihood and Bayesian inference, and arises in fields such as physics and genetics. Many methods proposed in statistical and other literature (e.g., computational physics) for dealing with this problem are based on various special cases of the following simple identity: c1 c2 = E2[q1(w)$\alpha$(w)] E1[q2(w)$\alpha$(w)] . Here Ei denotes the expectation with respect to pi (i = 1, 2), and $\alpha$ is an arbitrary function such that the denominator is non-zero. A main purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical study of the usefulness of this identity, with focus on (asymptotically) optimal and practical choices of $\alpha$. Using a simple but informative example, we demonstrate that with sensible (not necessarily optimal) choices of $\alpha$, we can reduce the simulation error by orders of magnitude when compared to the conventional importance sampling method, which corresponds to $\alpha$ = 1/q2. We also introduce several generalizations of this identity for handling more complicated settings (e.g., estimating several ratios simultaneously) and pose several open problems that appear to have practical as well as theoretical value. Furthermore, we discuss related theoretical and empirical work.},

abstract = {How big were the first planetesimals? We attempt to answer this question by conducting coagulation simulations in which the planetesimals grow by mutual collisions and form larger bodies and planetary embryos. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of the initial planetesimals is considered a free parameter in these simulations, and we search for the one that produces at the end objects with a SFD that is consistent with Asteroid belt constraints. We find that, if the initial planetesimals were small (e.g. km-sized), the final SFD fails to fulfill these constraints. In particular, reproducing the bump observed at diameter D ∼ 100 km in the current SFD of the asteroids requires that the minimal size of the initial planetesimals was also ∼100 km. This supports the idea that planetesimals formed big, namely that the size of solids in the proto-planetary disk "jumped" from sub-meter scale to multi-kilometer scale, without passing through intermediate values. Moreover, we find evidence that the initial planetesimals had to have sizes ranging from 100 to several 100 km, probably even 1000 km, and that their SFD had to have a slope over this interval that was similar to the one characterizing the current asteroids in the same size range. This result sets a new constraint on planetesimal formation models and opens new perspectives for the investigation of the collisional evolution in the Asteroid and Kuiper belts as well as of the accretion of the cores of the giant planets. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Murray2010,
abstract = {The Gaussian process (GP) is a popular way to specify dependencies between random variables in a probabilistic model. In the Bayesian framework the covariance structure can be specified using unknown hyperparameters. Integrating over these hyperparameters considers different possible explanations for the data when making predictions. This integration is often performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. However, with non-Gaussian observations standard hyperparameter sampling approaches require careful tuning and may converge slowly. In this paper we present a slice sampling approach that requires little tuning while mixing well in both strong- and weak-data regimes.},
