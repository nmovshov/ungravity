\subsection{Parameterization}\label{sec:params}
Consider the density profiles of the three-layer Uranus and Neptune models of
\citet{Nettelmann2013a}, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:N13_profs}. These profiles are
derived from models that solve the planetary structure equations for an assumed
composition, using physical equations of state. Our goal is to find a suitable
direct parameterization of density as a function of radius, $\rho(s)$, that is
capable of capturing the profiles of Fig.~\ref{fig:N13_profs} as a subset and is
otherwise as flexible as possible.
